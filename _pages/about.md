# ✌️ about me
I am now a postgraduate student from [School of life science](https://lifesciences.sysu.edu.cn/),[Sun Yat-sen_University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), majoring in Biology. My research interests primarily lie in the application of bioinformatics in animal breeding. I have participated in several relevant research  projects and published several articles during my postgraduate times. Currently,I am working on projects related to genome-wide association study and transcriptome study on fish breeding. Looking forward, I will be a Ph.D. candidate at Westlake University(https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) in Westlake University--SMART joint PhD programme(https://www.westlake.edu.cn/admissions_aid/graduate/zsdt1/202403/t20240304_37512.shtml) beginning Fall 2024.You can find my CV here:[Dingrui's Curriculum Vitae](assets/LIUDINGRUI CV.pdf). If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an email.


My research interest includes bioinformatics and animal breeding. I have published more than 10 papers at the top peer-reviewed journals with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

[Identification of SNPs and candidate genes associate with growth performance in all-female mandarin fish (*Siniperca chuatsi*) by a genome-wide association study](assets/1-s2.0-S0044848624002394-main.pdf), ***AQUACULTURE***

**Dingrui Liu**, Jin Zhang, Zhenjiang Zou, et al

- 
The first GWAS analysis on growth traits of all-female Mandarin fish (Dinggui I, *Siniperca Chuatsi*) was conducted. A total of 6 significant and 25 suggestive SNPs were detected on multiple chromosomes. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained for these SNPs ranged from 9.66% to 19.47% for growth traits.

[Effects of salinity on growth, physiology, biochemistry and gut microbiota of juvenile grass carp (*Ctenopharyngodon idella*)](assets/1-s2.0-S0166445X23000851-main.pdf), ***AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY***

**Dingrui Liu**, Zhuowei Zhang, Yikun Song, et al

- 
Grass carp exhibited great adaptability to low salinity (2 ppt), with no significant difference in growth and maintained stable physiological and immune status. However, exposed to high salinity (6 ppt) caused deleterious effects on grass carp, including growth inhibition as well as physiological and immune-related changes. The gut microbiota in grass carp changed with salinity.
